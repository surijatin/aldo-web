# ALDO Web Frontend & Backend

This project encompasses both the frontend and backend of a mock ALDO website, created for a Hackathon. It features an enhanced user interface, robust backend services, improved search functionality, and innovative object recognition features.

## Features
- **Improved Search Bar**: Advanced search capabilities for an optimal user experience.
- **Object Recognition**: Users can upload an image, and the backend processes it to display matching shoe products on the frontend.
- **Integrated Backend**: Supports the frontend with necessary data handling and services.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies using `npm install` in the frontend repository.
3. Start the development server using `npm start`

You can find the backend code in the `main.py` script.
